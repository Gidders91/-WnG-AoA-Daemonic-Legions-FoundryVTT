<p>Due to matters of timing and the main Abundance of Apocrypha document growing so large and unwieldy, I’ve chosen to break the bestiary sections off into their own smaller, more manageable supplements.</p>
<p>This bestiary deals with the Daemons of Chaos, immortal and terrifying beings that lurk in the Warp and plot the downfall of the entire universe.</p>
